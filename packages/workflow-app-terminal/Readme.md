# Workflow app for terminals

This package serves a dual purpose. It can be used in a graphical setting as a
fasade for the default terminal for the current platform or it can be used as 
a terminal window inside a terminal with a layout. Examples of this can be inside
`iterm` or `tmux`.

```
npm run example

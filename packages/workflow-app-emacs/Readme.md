# emacs app for workflow

Workflow emacs app with layout management within the emacs session.

The `SplitV` and `SplitH` layouts exported by `workflow-layouts-tiled` can be used to create
tiling layouts. The `File` and `Plugin.Magit.MagitStatus` exported by this package
is used to open buffers inside the layouts. Check out the [`Example.js`](flows/Example.js) example.

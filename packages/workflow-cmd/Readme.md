# workflow wm

This module is the entry point into workflow. It should be installed globally
by

```
npm install -g workflow-cmd
```

The installation will create a folder `~/.workflow` which contains the
configuration for workflow. Open this folder to add custom `apps` and `flows`.

See the [`readme`](template/Readme.md) for more information.
